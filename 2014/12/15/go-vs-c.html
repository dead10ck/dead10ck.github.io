    <p>This post is adapted from a term paper I wrote for my course on
Parallel Processing at San José State University. My comparison with C is
definitely very limited in scope—a more fair comparison would need
consideration of many other libraries besides <code>pthreads</code>. However, this
treatment would have taken much more time than I had in the semester.
In any case, my hope is that it is enlightening nonetheless.</p>

<p><br/>
In 2009, Google released the first open-source version of their new
compiled programming language Go. Go’s new and unusual approach to
facilitating parallel programming aims to make it much simpler to use
than most other languages, including C. This post will examine and compare
different aspects of Go’s and C’s approach to, and ability to
facilitate, parallel programming, including: ease of use, compile time,
performance and efficiency, fine-grained control, and proneness to bugs
such as deadlocks and race conditions.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Google has created a new compiled programming language called Go. It was
invented in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson, and
first released as open source in 2009 <a href="#goatgoogle">(Pike, n.d.; Golang.org, n.d.)</a>. Their main goal
was to design a language that would make life easier for software
engineers <a href="#goatgoogle">(Pike, n.d.)</a>. Go aims to be as easy to use as a scripting
language, but as fast as a compiled language <a href="#faq">(Golang.org, n.d.)</a>. It features automatic
memory management (garbage collection), type safety, a built-in suite of
developer tools, and most importantly, its built-in concurrency
primitives. Go takes a new and unusual approach to concurrency which
makes it much simpler to use than C. The traditional approach to safe
multithreading, as in C, is to use synchronization primitives, such as
semaphores, locks, and condition variables. Go uses a different model,
inspired by the formal language Communicating Sequential Processes
(CSP);<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> the mantra of Go’s memory model is: “Do not communicate by
sharing memory; instead, share memory by
communicating” <a href="#sharebycommunicating">(Gerrand, 2010)</a>.</p>

<p>This paper will compare different aspects of C and Go’s approach to, and
ability to facilitate, parallel programming, including: ease of use,
compile time, performance and efficiency, fine-grained control, and
proneness to bugs such as deadlocks and race conditions. There are
several C libraries which facilitate multithreaded programming, and
since comparing C’s approach with all libraries would be infeasible,
this paper will only discuss the approach with the POSIX Threads (or
pthreads) library, since it represents and showcases the most
traditional and standard approach to managing multithreaded
applications.</p>

<h1>Overview of Go</h1>

<p>In order to fully understand Go’s approach to concurrency, it is
necessary to cover some of the fundamentals of the language. Go includes
a few built-in primitives: slices, maps, and channels. The latter is
specifically designed to facilitate concurrency through Go’s shared
memory model via goroutines.</p>

<h2 id="goroutines">Goroutines</h2>

<p>The basic thread of execution in Go is called a goroutine, so named
because the Go team felt the existing terms (threads, coroutines,
processes, etc.) convey inaccurate connotations <a href="#effectivego">(Golang.org, n.d.)</a>. Goroutines
have a simpler model. They are simply functions executing in the same
address space. According to Golang.org’s document “Effective Go,”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[They are] lightweight, costing little more than the allocation of
stack space. And the stacks start small, so they are cheap, and grow
by allocating (and freeing) heap storage as required. Goroutines are
multiplexed onto multiple OS threads so if one should block, such as
while waiting for I/O, others continue to run. Their design hides many
of the complexities of thread creation and management <a href="#effectivego">(Golang.org, n.d.)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The traditional approach to thread management can indeed be cumbersome.
For example, in C with pthreads, to create a handful of threads which
execute in parallel, the programmer has to do something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">ret</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">NUM_THREADS</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">pthread_join</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">thd_handle</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="o">**</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">ret</span> <span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="c1">// do something with ret</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The programmer must explicitly store all threads in a variable, and then
wait for each individual thread to exit, doing something with its return
value after each successful termination. Also, because pthreads must
take untyped (void) parameters, the data may have to be casted to and
from its actual type multiple times, while making sure pointers are
dereferenced appropriately–giving us such unwieldy code as
<code>(void**)&amp;ret</code>.</p>

<p>Go’s approach is much simpler. To launch a goroutine, the programmer
simply puts the keyword <code>go</code> in front of a function call. For example,
<code>go list.Sort()</code> will launch a goroutine which sorts <code>list</code>
concurrently, without waiting for it to finish. In this trivial example,
though, we don’t see how to handle return values or shared data
synchronization. In order for goroutines to communicate, Go makes use of
primitives called <em>channels</em>.</p>

<h2>Channels</h2>

<p>Go’s approach to concurrency is designed to avoid explicit
synchronization by the programmer, which can be difficult to manage.
Traditionally, synchronization of data occurs through the use of
primitives such as semaphores, locks, and condition variables.
Typically, the programmer must protect shared data and critical code
blocks from hazards by using something like a mutex variable with a
condition variable.</p>

<p>For example, with the pthreads library in C, to synchronize a
multithreaded program that fits the producer–consumer model,<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> one
first has to set up a synchronized data structure which encapsulates
both the payload and its synchronization locks:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="k">typedef</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">pthread_mutex_t</span>     <span class="n">mutex</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kt">pthread_cond_t</span>  <span class="n">cv</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span>         <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="n">flag</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="n">flag</span> <span class="n">ourFlag</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then, any time the programmer wishes to perform operations on the data,
and then have an independent thread wait for changes to that data before
proceeding, it is necessary to explicitly lock the variable, perform the
operations, and signal the condition to allow the waiting threads to
execute.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

        <span class="c1">// create worker threads</span>
        <span class="p">...</span>
        <span class="n">pthread_mutex_lock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">ourFlag</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">mutex</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="n">ourFlag</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">someValue</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="n">pthread_cond_broadcast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">ourFlag</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">cv</span><span class="p">);</span>

        <span class="p">...</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Similarly, within the worker thread, one must wait on the mutex lock,
then wait on the condition variable before doing something with the
changed data.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">    <span class="kt">void</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="nf">workerThread</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

        <span class="p">...</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In order to avoid data hazards and/or race conditions, access to the
data must be explicitly managed by the programmer by bundling the
synchronization primitives with the payload, and then acquiring and
releasing locks and signaling to the other threads when they may
continue. The use of <em>semaphores</em> can make this a bit simpler, but they
are limited when dealing with multiple consumer threads, so condition
variables are the best general solution <a href="#multicoreprogramming">(Akhter &amp; Roberts, 2006, p. 132)</a>.
The explicit management required by this approach is exactly the kind of
manual tracking that Go was designed to avoid.</p>

<p>Go takes a different approach to the problem of thread communication and
synchronization through the use of built-in primitives called channels.
A <em>channel</em> is defined by the Go Language Specification as a primitive
which “provides a mechanism for two concurrently executing functions to
synchronize execution and communicate by passing a value of a specified
element type” <a href="#spec">(Golang.org, n.d.)</a>. They work in a manner analogous to Unix pipes—data
values are written to them (<em>sent</em>) and read from them (<em>received</em>) in a
first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner. In fact, the document “Effective Go”
says that they “can... be seen as a type-safe generalization of Unix
pipes” <a href="#sharebycommunicating">(Gerrand, 2010)</a>. The typical flow of a multithreaded program
in Go involves setting up communication channels, and then passing these
channels to all goroutines which need to communicate. Worker goroutines
send processed data to the channel, and goroutines which need to wait on
work done by others will do so by receiving from this channel.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nx">WorkerGoroutine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span> <span class="p">[]</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">c</span> <span class="kd">chan</span> <span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>As the reader can see, there is no need to set up any explicit data
synchronization. Channels are inherently hazard safe, and blocking and
signaling are done automatically.</p>

<p>The above example used <em>buffered</em> channels. Channels can either be
buffered or not, depending on their use case. An unbuffered channel c
would be declared like so (without a second parameter):
<code>c := make(chan int)</code> Sending on an unbuffered channel will block until
the receiver receives the value, whereas sending on a buffered channel
will only block if the buffer is full, and receives will block only if
the buffer is empty. One use of this is to limit throughput. The
document “Effective Go” includes an example in which one can use
channels like semaphores to limit the number of simultaneous goroutines
that handle requests <a href="#effectivego">(Golang.org, n.d.)</a>.</p>

    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The Go team does, however, acknowledge that the approach with channels
is not a universal solution. The Go team says that “This approach can be
taken too far. Reference counts may be best done by putting a mutex
around an integer variable, for instance” <a href="#sharebycommunicating">(Gerrand, 2010)</a>. Channels
are ultimately a high level solution, and sometimes lower-level
solutions are needed. For this purpose, the Go standard library does
include packages with lower-level synchronization primitives, such as
the <code>sync</code> package, which includes mutex types and condition
types <a href="#package-sync">(Golang.org, n.d.)</a>. See section <a href="#fine">Fine-grained control</a> for more detail.</p>

<h2>Memory model</h2>

<p>From the previous examples, one can understand the difference in
approach. With the traditional approach to synchronization in C, the
memory model can be very cumbersome. Much of the hazard safety is left
as the responsibility of the programmer, who must explicitly restrict
access to shared data by communicating to other threads, via
synchronization primitives, when the data is being used and when the
data is free. Go makes this easier for the programmer with a simpler
shared memory model. Data is never actively shared between separate
threads of communication—it is just passed around in channels. Thus,
data races cannot happen, by design, when the data are passed between
channels. The document “Effective Go” explains that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One way to think about this model is to consider a typical
single-threaded program running on one CPU. It has no need for
synchronization primitives. Now run another such instance; it too
needs no synchronization. Now let those two communicate; if the
communication is the synchronizer, there’s still no need for other
synchronization <a href="#sharebycommunicating">(Gerrand, 2010)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why the Go team has reduced the model to a slogan: “<em>Do not
communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by
communicating.</em>”<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<h1>Proneness to deadlocks and race conditions</h1>

<p>Although Go takes a very different approach to concurrency than C, it is
ultimately a lower level language, and thus it can be easy to write code
which does not behave as expected. While Go’s concurrency primitives can
make it easier to avoid data hazards, they are not a panacea—the
programmer does still have to be mindful of race conditions.</p>

<h2>A simple example</h2>

<p>In C, without explicitly locking critical code, data races are very
likely to happen. As a simple example, consider a multithreaded program
which increments a shared integer variable a set number of times.<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="kt">void</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="nf">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">ret</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">1000000</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="n">ret</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>If, say, 4 threads were running the sum function concurrently, then by
the time all threads have finished, the value in the <code>ret</code> variable
would not be 4 million. It would, in fact, be a different number every
time the program was run. One could easily construct a Go program with
analogous behavior.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nx">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">ret</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">done</span> <span class="kd">chan</span> <span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So the question that remains is: how easy is it to avoid race conditions
like this?</p>

<h2>Avoiding race conditions</h2>

<p>As we have seen, in C, to avoid race conditions, one could use a mutex
variable to protect any shared data. To fix the example C code above,
one could lock just before incrementing the shared variable, and then
unlock just after.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="kt">void</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="nf">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">ret</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">1000000</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">pthread_mutex_lock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">mutex</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="n">ret</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="n">pthread_mutex_unlock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">mutex</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Similarly, for analogous Go code, one could use a buffered channel of
size 1 to restrict access to the sum variable to one goroutine at a
time.<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nx">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">sumChan</span> <span class="kd">chan</span> <span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">done</span> <span class="kd">chan</span> <span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">1000000</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">++</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c1">// sumChan has a buffer of size 1, so receiving blocks if there</span>
        <span class="c1">// is another goroutine currently incrementing the sum</span>
        <span class="nx">cur</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="nx">sumChan</span>
        <span class="nx">cur</span><span class="o">++</span>
        <span class="nx">sumChan</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="nx">cur</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="nx">done</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In this simple case, the solutions are not terribly different. However,
as we can gather from the previous Go code examples, channels can be
very flexible in their usage. Where C needs distinct synchronization
primitives, such as mutex variables, condition variables, and
semaphores, to handle all of the different use cases, Go’s channels can
be used: as a hazard-safe conduit to share actual data; to signal when a
goroutine is finished; and as a way to limit the throughput of the
program. In other words, good solutions exist in both languages, but
Go’s channels provide a much more effortless way to design programs
which are safe from race conditions.</p>

<h3>Detecting race conditions</h3>

<p>No matter how skilled a programmer is, race conditions will inevitably
arise. Therefore, tools to help the programmer detect race conditions
are necessary. Various tools exist which analyze a C program’s runtime
to aid the detection of race conditions. A common tool is Valgrind,
which includes the race detector Helgrind <a href="#valgrind">(Valgrind.org, n.d.)</a>. The Go tool chain
comes packaged with a race detector, which is built on the
ThreadSanitizer race detector for C/C++ <a href="#race">(Vyukov &amp; Gerrand, n.d.)</a>. To run the race detector
on a Go program, one can simply use the <code>-race</code> option when compiling
(e.g. <code>go run -race mysrc.go</code>). Similarly, <code>gcc</code> comes bundled with
ThreadSanitizer, so to run the race detector on a C program, one would
simply compile with the <code>-fsanitize=thread</code> and <code>-fPIE</code> options and then
link to <code>-fsanitize=thread -pie</code> <a href="#threadsanitizer">(Code.google.com, n.d.)</a>. Therefore, the options
for helping detect race conditions are similar for both C and Go.</p>

<h2>Deadlocks</h2>

<p>Deadlocks are one of the trickiest bugs to remediate. Often, they are
transient and very difficult to trace (especially in a large project).
Deadlocks take care to avoid in both C and Go. Mechanisms and
methodologies exist in both languages to aid in avoiding deadlocks.</p>

<h3>Data segmentation/replication</h3>

<p>If it is possible, replicating the shared resource for each thread will
eliminate deadlocks, because no locking mechanism is needed for
synchronization <a href="#multicoreprogramming">(Akhter &amp; Roberts, 2006, p. 178)</a>. For example, in C, if the
shared resource is an array, then replication can be done with the
<code>memcpy</code> function. Although, if the data set is not small, replicating
can consume too much memory. Therefore, if the concurrent operations are
independent from each other, it is better to segment the shared data,
rather than replicate it.</p>

<p>In Go, segmentation can be done easily with its built-in <code>slice</code> type.
Go’s <code>slice</code> type is similar to Python’s <code>slice</code> type. Slices are
references to an underlying array, and they provide operators which make
it easy to segment that array. For example, one can “reslice” a slice
with the bracket operator. If <code>arr</code> is a slice variable, then
<code>arr[:len(arr)/2]</code> will return a slice which can access the first half
of <code>arr</code>’s elements.<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> Thus, if <code>sum</code> is a function which returns the
sum of every element of an integer slice, then</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="nx">arr</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="p">[]</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="nx">partSums</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="nx">partSums</span>
<span class="nx">fmt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Println</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>will launch two goroutines which sum the first and second half of <code>arr</code>,
respectively, and receive both partial sums from the <code>partSums</code> channel.
Then, these two partial sums are added together to yield the correct sum
of all the elements in arr—in this case, 12. Segmenting the data like
this avoids the need for any communication between the two goroutines,
as well as the need to replicate any data (since slices are simply
references). A similar functionality could be achieved in C, although
the segmentation would have to be done manually; the <code>sum</code> function, for
instance, might need to take parameters for the beginning and ending
indices of which elements in the shared array to sum. In both languages,
if data segmentation is possible, this is a good way to avoid deadlocks.
It obviates the need to use any kind of synchronization locks.</p>

<h3>Try and back off</h3>

<p>However, when locks are unavoidable, there exist methodologies in both C
and Go to help avoid deadlocking. When using mutex variables to guard
critical code sections, one approach is to instruct a thread to release
any resources it currently holds if locking another resource results in
failure <a href="#multicoreprogramming">(Akhter &amp; Roberts, 2006, p. 180)</a>. In C, this can be done with the
<code>pthread</code> function <code>pthread_mutex_trylock</code>.<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">pthread_mutex_lock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">mutex1</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pthread_mutex_trylock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">mutex2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="k">break</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
        <span class="n">pthread_mutex_unlock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">mutex2</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Go, however, if mutex variables absolutely must be used, this
approach may not work, as mutex behavior is more strict than in C’s
<code>pthread</code> library. In Go, there is no analogous “trylock” function on
its mutex type; furthermore, it is a runtime error if the <code>Unlock</code>
function is called on a mutex which is already unlocked,<a href="#package-sync">(Golang.org, n.d.)</a> so
greater care must be given to restrict the ordering of lock and unlock
operations.</p>

<h3>Go’s <code>select</code> statement</h3>

<p>However, in a typical Go program where channels suffice for
synchronization, a different approach may be used to avoid deadlocking
on channel blocks. In Go, the <code>select</code> statement is analogous to a
<code>switch</code> statement for channels. Essentially, the cases will try to
execute a given operation on a channel, and if that operation <em>would</em>
block, then it tries a different case.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go">    <span class="k">select</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="nx">a</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="nx">ch1</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="c1">// use a</span>
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="nx">b</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="nx">ch2</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="c1">// use b</span>
    <span class="k">default</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="c1">// receiving from both a and b would block</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, if the program can receive from the channel <code>ch1</code>, then it assigns
the received value to the variable <code>a</code>, and <code>a</code> can be used within the
code below the case statement. Similarly, if the program can receive
from <code>ch2</code>, it assigns the received value to the variable <code>b</code>, which can
be used in the code following the case statement. If both <code>ch1</code> and
<code>ch2</code> are ready, the program picks one case at random. If neither are
ready, the code in the default case is run. Therefore, a tactic
analogous to the “try and back off” method can be used.<sup id="fnref8"><a href="#fn8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go">    <span class="nx">OuterLoop</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">a</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="nx">ch1</span>
        <span class="k">select</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">case</span> <span class="nx">b</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="nx">ch2</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">break</span> <span class="nx">OuterLoop</span>
        <span class="k">default</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="nx">ch1</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="nx">a</span>
            <span class="c1">// wait</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="c1">// use a and b</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Given how flexible channels are in general, there are, of course, many
more ways one can use the select statement to avoid deadlocks. For
example, in his article “Go Concurrency Patterns: Timing out, moving
on,” Andrew Gerrand describes how one could implement a simple timeout
operation with channels <a href="#concurrency-patterns">(Gerrand, n.d.)</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="nx">timeout</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nb">make</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">chan</span> <span class="kt">bool</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">go</span> <span class="kd">func</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">time</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Sleep</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nx">time</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Second</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nx">timeout</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="kc">true</span>
<span class="p">}()</span>

<span class="k">select</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="k">case</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="nx">ch</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="c1">// a read from ch has occurred</span>
<span class="k">case</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="nx">timeout</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="c1">// the read from ch has timed out</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In the above code, a “timeout” channel is created, and an anonymous
function is launched in a goroutine which sends a value to the timeout
channel after one second. In the select statement that follows, the main
goroutine is blocked until one of the select cases can happen. If it
takes too long to receive from ch (i.e., if the operation takes too
long), then the select statement receives from the timeout channel and
the program continues.</p>

<h1 id="fine">Fine-grained control</h1>

<p>As we have seen, Go is intended to be somewhere in between the level of
a scripting language and that of a lower-level language, like C. It is
not surprising, then, to learn that C provides a finer level of control
over the behavior of the program’s threads than Go does. However, Go
does include some reflective functions which provide some finer-grained
control over the execution of the program, if so needed. Ultimately,
though, the memory models of Go and C are anything but isomorphic, so
the comparison between each language’s runtime may not be apt.</p>

<h2>Thread attributes in C</h2>

<p>In C with <code>pthreads</code>, there are a few standard thread attributes which
can be set when threads are created. These attributes include: its
detached or joinable state; scheduling inheritance, policies,
parameters, and contention scopes, and stack size <a href="#pthreads">(Barney, n.d.)</a>. As an
example, if the programmer knows that a thread will never need to join
with another, they can set the thread’s attributes such that it will
always be detached, and thus, not joinable with any thread, for the
duration of its execution.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="kt">pthread_t</span> <span class="kr">thread</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kt">pthread_attr_t</span> <span class="n">attr</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="n">pthread_attr_init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">attr</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">pthread_attr_setdetachstate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">attr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="n">pthread_create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="kr">thread</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">attr</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">SomeFunction</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Similarly, one can set the scheduling policy of a thread with
attributes. There are three scheduling types in pthreads: <code>SCHED_FIFO</code>
(first-in, first-out), <code>SCHED_RR</code> (round robin), or
<code>SCHED_OTHER</code>,<a href="#pthreads">(Barney, n.d.)</a>-attributes which can be set in a similar manner.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="n">pthread_attr_init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">attr</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">pthread_attr_setschedpolicy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">attr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">SCHED_FIFO</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This example would set the execution policy of any threads created with
the <code>attr</code> variable to run in a FIFO order. Similar mechanisms exist for
all the other attributes. Some local implementations of pthreads include
a <code>pthread_setaffinity_np</code> function, which allows the programmer to
specify which processor/core they would like the thread to run
on <a href="#pthreads">(Barney, n.d.)</a>.</p>

<h2>Fine-grained control in Go</h2>

<p>As this author has previously discussed, the memory model in Go is much
different. Go does not run traditional threads—it runs goroutines. This
memory model is designed to be much more lightweight and easier to use
than the traditional approach; thus, many of the fine-grained details
are abstracted away from the programmer. However, because these details
are not always avoidable, Go does provide some packages which allow
access to lower-level synchronization primitives and runtime scheduling.</p>

<p>For example, the <code>sync</code> package provides more traditional
synchronization primitives, such as mutex and condition variables, as
well as the <code>WaitGroup</code> type, which allows the programmer to explicitly
wait on a set of goroutines to finish. The subpackage <code>sync/atomic</code>
provides even lower-level functions which assist in implementation of
synchronization algorithms by providing various operations which are
guaranteed to be atomic <a href="#package-atomic">(Golang.org, n.d.)</a>. The <code>runtime</code> package provides
functions which interact with Go’s runtime directly. Some example
functions include: <code>runtime.Gosched()</code>, which yields the current
goroutine, allowing others to run; <code>runtime.LockOSThread()</code>, which locks
a goroutine to whichever OS thread it happens to be running on; and
various reflective functions which report runtime information, such as
<code>runtime.Stack()</code>, which prints stack trace information <a href="#package-runtime">(Golang.org, n.d.)</a>.</p>

<p>Go does not provide mechanisms to control thread attributes as seen in
section <a href="#fine">Fine-grained control</a>, however, because goroutines operate on a higher level
than threads. As discussed in section <a href="#goroutines">Goroutines</a>, goroutines are
managed dynamically and multiplexed onto multiple OS threads, so
providing lower-level control mechanisms than those shown above is not
really feasible. Most of the time, this works out in the programmer’s
favor, as they do not have to manage as much manually, but these control
mechanisms can be missed if the application calls for them.</p>

<h1>Performance</h1>

<p>For the most part, the comparisons here are not directly related to each
language’s ability to facilitate parallel programs, but performance is
nonetheless an important factor when deciding which language to
implement an application with.</p>

<h2 id="compilation">Compilation time</h2>

<p>One of the major reasons why Google decided to write a new compiled
language was because the compile times of their large C++ code bases
grew to be a significant engineering problem <a href="#goatgoogle">(Pike, n.d.)</a>. Rob Pike
discusses this problem in the document “Go at Google” <a href="#goatgoogle">(Pike, n.d.)</a>. C and
C++ use preprocessor directives to manage dependencies, which does not
scale well for very large projects. Typically, a C/C++ header file will
use <code>#ifndef</code> guards to protect against errors when multiple source
files <code>#include</code> the same library. If a dependency is included multiple
times, after the first compilation, the contents are disregarded, but
the compiler still opens and scans the whole file. As an example, Pike
noted that for one large project at Google in 2007, a code base of 4.2
MB expanded to over 8 GB when delivered to the compiler because of all
the repeated dependencies <a href="#goatgoogle">(Pike, n.d.)</a>. For this reason, it was
impractical to build large projects on a single machine, so Google had
to design a large distributed compilation system. With an early version
of this distributed system, the binary took 45 minutes to compile. At
the time of this writing, Pike’s document says the same 2007 binary
takes 27 minutes to compile today.</p>

<p>Pike says that “the origin myth for Go states that it was during one of
those 45 minute builds that Go was conceived” <a href="#goatgoogle">(Pike, n.d.)</a>. The Go
compiler was based on an approach that the Plan 9 team designed to
remedy the repeated dependency problems described above.<sup id="fnref9"><a href="#fn9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>
Essentially, how it works is it builds a dependency graph from the
source files themselves by reading all of the import statements from
every file, and then compiling the lowest-level dependencies first by
compiling every source file in topologically sorted order. Note that
this implies that there are no cycles in the dependency graph—it was
decided to make circular dependencies illegal <a href="#goatgoogle">(Pike, n.d.)</a>. When the
compiler progresses in its traversal of the sorted dependency graph, if
the file being built includes a file which has already been compiled, it
only reads that dependency’s object file, not its source code. Pike
notes that this design “has the important effect that when the compiler
executes an import clause, it opens exactly one file, the object file
identified by the string in the import clause…in effect, the compiler
writes the header file when the Go source file is
compiled” <a href="#goatgoogle">(Pike, n.d.)</a>.<sup id="fnref10"><a href="#fn10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

<p>In addition to this, the language itself was designed with efficient
compile time in mind. Its compact grammar and regular syntax makes it
much easier to parse <a href="#decl-syntax">(Pike, n.d.)</a>. For instance, requiring opening braces
to be kept on the same line as its function declaration allowed
semicolon insertion to happen without the need for lookahead <a href="#faq">(Golang.org, n.d.)</a>. Go
does not have inheritance; instead, it relies on a simple interface
system, which greatly simplifies the underlying type system, and the
structure of Go programs <a href="#faq">(Golang.org, n.d.)</a>.</p>

<p>When testing the results of this design on a large binary, Google
recorded a speedup of about 40x <a href="#goatgoogle">(Pike, n.d.)</a>. During one of Google’s Tech
Talks in 2009, Rob Pike gave a demonstration of how fast the Go compiler
was. On Pike’s single-core laptop, building the entire Go source tree,
which he estimated at about 120,000–130,000 lines and included “regular
expressions, flags, concurrency primitives, the runtime, [and] the
garbage collector…” took about 8 seconds <a href="#tech-talk">(Pike, 2009)</a>. Today, the standard
library comes in at over 400,000 lines of code, and on this author’s
laptop with a 4-core Intel i3-3110M CPU, compile time averages around 8
seconds on a cold cache. It is clear that for large projects, the
compile time of Go wins over C/C++.</p>

<h2>Raw performance</h2>

<p>Unsurprisingly, typical performance of a Go program is much faster than
most scripting languages and slightly slower than most other lower-level
languages, like C. In the Computer Language Benchmarks Game, a web site which
hosts programming language benchmarks, in
their “Ten Tiny Examples,” Go comes in at the same order of
magnitude of relative performance of Java, Scala, Haskell, and
OCaml <a href="#debian-benchmark">(Gouy, n.d.)</a>. These were slightly slower than C++, Ada, C, and
Fortran, but much faster than PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, and Hack. It is
worth mentioning, however, that the site does disclaim that language
comparison benchmarks are not representative of real-world performance;
they warn not to jump to conclusions based on these tests because
“programming languages are compared against each other as though their
designers intended them to be used for the exact same purpose – that
just isn’t so” <a href="#debian-benchmark-conclusion">(Gouy, n.d.)</a>.</p>

<p>In 2011, Robert Hundt, one of Google’s own software engineers, published
a paper entitled “Loop Recognition in C++/Java/Go/Scala” which compared
performances of those languages with a particular loop recognition
algorithm <a href="#loop-recognition">(Hundt, 2011)</a>. Hundt found that the Go implementation
described in the paper fell behind all other languages considered by a
significant margin. However, Russ Cox, from the Go team, wrote an
article that examined the paper, and found that the reason for the slow
performance was mostly because of the naïveté of the
implementation <a href="#profiling">(Cox, 2013)</a>. Cox took the paper as an opportunity to
showcase the Go performance profiler. After some analysis and a few
minor tweaks to the code published in the paper, the program improved
from 25.2 seconds and 1302MB of memory to 2.29 seconds and 351MB of
memory—a speedup of 11x. Cox also noticed some inefficiencies in the C++
implementation and fixed those as well so that a new comparison would be
fair. It was found that Go performed slightly slower than C++—as
expected. Cox concluded that “benchmarks are only as good as the
programs they measure” and that Go can be competitive with C++ (and by
extension, all other compiled languages, depending on the application)
when care is taken to avoid generating excess garbage <a href="#profiling">(Cox, 2013)</a>.</p>

<p>These are, of course, only two examples of performance measurement, but
in general, it is expected that Go, in its current state, will follow
this pattern—being much faster than scripting languages, but slightly
behind most other compiled languages. This is not surprising, given that
Go is such a new language. Being a modern compiled language, it will be
much faster than any interpreted language, but the compiler has not had
the decades of optimizations that, say, the C compiler has had. In
addition, as discussed in section <a href="#compilation">Compilation time</a>, because one of the
primary goals of the language was to compile fast, it does not
necessarily spend as much time passing the code through optimizers.
According to a question on the Go FAQ, “one of Go’s design goals is to
approach the performance of C for comparable programs” while being much
easier to use <a href="#faq">(Golang.org, n.d.)</a>. The same question concludes that, while there is
certainly room for improvement in the compiler, standard library
implementations, and the garbage collector, Go can be competitive for
many applications.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Go is an exciting new language which introduces many interesting
features which make many aspects of programming much easier,
particularly in implementing parallel programs. Go makes use of a simple
memory model with goroutines to automatically manage multiple threads of
execution, which can be much easier than the manual approach that is
required in C. Through the use of channels, Go makes inter-process
communication much simpler than traditional mechanisms. Both Go and C
are equally prone to deadlocks and race conditions, and both come with
comparable tools and techniques to help debug these issues. Since Go is
designed to be simpler, it is not possible to reach quite the level of
control over threads that C can achieve, so if such control is
necessary, C may be better suited. For very large projects, Go compiles
faster than C and C++ by an order of magnitude, while actual program
performance will typically fall slightly behind C/C++. The goal of Go
was to approach the performance of C and to make software engineering
much simpler; given the analysis in this paper, it appears the Go team
has achieved that goal remarkably well.</p>

<p>There are many other interesting features and idioms in Go which are
outside the scope of this paper. To learn more, the official web site
provides excellent and thorough documentation of the language, and the
Go Blog has many in-depth articles that cover: the inner-workings of Go,
idiomatic practices, and how to use the included tool suite. Many large
companies have started adopting Go, including: BBC Worldwide, Bitbucket,
GitHub, Canonical, Heroku, SoundCloud, and Docker, among
others <a href="#currently-using">(go-wiki, n.d.)</a>.</p>
